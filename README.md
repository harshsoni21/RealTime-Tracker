# Real-Time Tracker Feature

This project implements a real-time tracking feature using `socket.io` for real-time communication, Node.js for the backend, and the `leaflet` library for interactive maps. The feature allows users to track objects or individuals on a map in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates:** Track the location of objects or individuals in real-time.
- **Interactive Maps:** Utilize the `leaflet` library for dynamic and interactive maps.
- **Scalable Backend:** Built with Node.js to handle multiple real-time connections efficiently.
- **Socket.io Integration:** Real-time communication between server and client using `socket.io`.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Backend server to handle requests and real-time communication.
- **Socket.io:** Library for real-time web applications.
- **Leaflet:** JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **Express:** Web framework for Node.js.
